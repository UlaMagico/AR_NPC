Ah, a new traveler! Welcome to Eldenport, the jewel of the southern coast.
You see that lighthouse up on the cliffs?
It used to guide countless ships home.
But lately... strange shadows have been seen near it.
If you’re the adventurous type, I could use your help.
There’s an old legend about Captain Rynn’s compass — said to always point toward treasure.
Find that compass for me, and you’ll earn not just gold, but the trust of Eldenport’s people.
So, what do you say, traveler? Will you accept the quest?
